	<h1>About Samal</h1>
    <p>
        The name Samal was derived from the Sama-Bajau peoples, the natives who were the first inhabitants of the island. 
        The first datu on the island was Datu Taganiyug, a native of what is now Pe単aplata, today the governance center of the city. 
        In the past, the people of the island named a place about what the said place is known for. 
        For example, the name Pe単aplata is said to be derived from the word "pi単a" or pineapple because of the abundance of pineapple in the area; 
        this, however, is folk etymology, for Pe単aplata means "rock of silver" in Spanish. Tagpopongan is the first barangay on the island whose name 
        was from the word "tagpo" or meet. It was so called because this place was chosen by the datus as their meeting place. 
        The word Samal was also known before because it was commonly used as a surname by datu.
    </p>
	<h2>Early beginnings</h2>
    <p>
	The island was initially home to the Muslim Sama-Bajau people, though it was also settled by the animistic Mansakas and Mandayas from northern and eastern parts of Davao Region in 	the mainland. These settlers intermarried and were organized into communities, dynastically ruled by a datu until the early 20th century. Centuries later, Spain first reached Samal 	Island and managed to conquer the island in the late 1840s when Nueva Vergara (Davao City today) in the mainland was established.
   </p>
	<h3>World War 2</h3>
   <p>The Pacific War, which happened during World War II, struck the island. Japanese fighter planes bombed the island. Japanese forces occupied the island and forced the people to work 	for four years until they were expelled by the Allied forces. After the war, infrastructure was built, such as schools, churches, and stores in the area.
	</p>
	<h4>Official founding of the municipality</h4>
	<p>
	The time came on July 8, 1948, when the entire island itself became part of the newly created municipality of Samal;[6] it was the official founding of the municipality. Five 	years later in 1953, the municipality of Babak was created from Samal,[7] marking the political division of the island between the two municipalities. The island experienced 	further political division when the municipality of Kaputian was created from the island in 1966.[8] During this period, the standard of living in these three municipalities became 	low and extremely rural.
